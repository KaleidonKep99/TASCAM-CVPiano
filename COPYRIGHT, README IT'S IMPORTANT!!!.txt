The samples are NOT mine!!!
These samples have been recorded by specialized TASCAM operators,
and have been extracted from the original CVPiano VST, that you can find here:

I am NOT the owner of both samples and VST, I just ported them to the soundfont format.

Original description of the VST:

Eliminating the need for many bulky, discrete sample layers, spectral morphing technology* produces continuous,
spectral variation by processing only a single baseline sample velocity. 

Using the baseline as a starting point, the spectral morphing filters then dynamically interpolate frequency characteristics,
which can then be continuously morphed during and after musical notes are played.
The result is far greater musicality with over ten times the amount of dynamic expression.
Another benefit is that instruments are much smaller in memory consumption, yet with greater playability and realism.

The Piano is a KAWAI grand piano, 7'4", residing in Electric LarryLand Studios, Austin, TX.
The piano had been recently rebuilt, and is known for it's shimmering, clear tone.
It has been used on many recordings made by nine-time Grammy winning engineer, Larry Seyer.
